With it's four bedrooms and three baths, it was the perfect size for all of us. Beautiful yet comfortable furnishings... a kitchen that had everything you would ever need... but I think our favorite parts were the upper and lower decks. The upper deck had a huge table with umbrella and BBQ pit, while the downstairs deck had comfortable seating to where you could have a lazy afternoon reading or walk right out and into the water for a lazy day on the floats or get into your boat and tour the lake. We brought our own lily pad float plus two kayaks so we were always in the water. There were two blowup tubs and two paddle boads that came with the house and we had those out every day. We all just had an amazing time and we wouldn't hesitate to stay there again! Elizabeth was an incredible host from the beginning when we reserved the house until our last day there.", stars: 4 },

Grounds are well maintained with plenty of parking and lots of open grassy area to walk pets. It is also located just a few yards from The Southern Empress Paddle boat... Best part was fishing right from the patio! ..The condos were built in the 80's, with that in mind they are a bit outdated but well kept.", stars: 3 },

They were extremely quick to respond. My daughter wanted to fish while we were there. Our host went out of his way to pick up bait and drop it off for her to fish off the porch. She caught 4 sunfish (1 we threw back), and 2 catfish. He also picked up 2 larger size coffee cups because all they had were smaller ones (which I knew I would end up overflowing üòù), and more coffee. The bed and sofa was comfortable, and it‚Äôs so nice to wake up to such a pretty view too. Our dogs stayed looking out the windows and glass door the entire time we were there. We would book again!", stars: 4 },

This is our second stay and we honestly look forward to returning much sooner. The home was spotless, plenty of bathroom linens and relaxing bedrooms with a view. We felt right at home. Our stay was relaxing and we were not on our phones the whole stay! The neighborhood was quiet, and the morning drive to Starbucks you‚Äôd see deer walking around unbothered. If you crave a peaceful yet productive get away from home, this is your place. Also plenty to do around the area outdoors as well too", stars: 5 },

I had a question that turned out to be an easy fix and he helped me quickly and politely, even took the initiative to volunteer addition information regarding our stay (tips about the house and the area). The place was very nice and outside was even better! Being on the lake was such a fun time and so peaceful. All of the houses in this are kind of on a cliff so be careful if you have young kids that will b-line to the water. Great stay, highly recommend!", stars: 3 },

It was Exceptional ! Any questions we had he was there to answer them expeditiously. The view at Austin‚Äôs place was amazing as it sits right on the water. The plus is the local wildlife that was passing though. It was so beautiful to see all the different animals just freely roaming. The check in and out process was super smooth and we could not be more thankful for the amazing hospitality!", stars: 4 },

The kayaks and fishing were just the cherry on top of the deer watching, hot tub, and the awesome hammock chair on the main deck. I even went so far as to suggesting to our extended family that we make Lake Robins Nest one of the options for our annual summer vacation in Central Texas!

Furniture, beds, and linens were comfy, and nights were quiet. The neighborhood was a hidden gem, with rolling hills, kind people, beautiful nature, and quirky-cute.
